# electron-link-demo

This is a simple demo to show ipcMain and ipcRenderer of Electron for SoCal React x NodeLA Meetup based on [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start).

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.

You can learn more about each of these components within the [Quick Start Guide](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start).
